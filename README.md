# File Organizer

This Python project organizes files in a selected directory by moving them into folders such as Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Code, Applications, Fonts, and Others.

## Week 1 Focus

The Week 1 report describes these goals:

- Scan a directory.
- Identify file types using file extensions.
- Create category folders when needed.
- Move files into the correct folders.
- Handle already existing folders with conditional checks.
- Use Python file handling with `os` or `shutil`.

This version implements those points and also includes a simple Tkinter interface so the user can select a directory easily.

## Files

- `main.py`: Tkinter user interface.
- `organizer.py`: File categorization and moving logic.
- `settings.py`: Saved preferences for directory, output folder, recursive mode, and custom categories.
- `USER_GUIDE.md`: User-facing instructions.
- `test_organizer.py`: Unit tests for the backend organizer logic.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Choose a folder, then click **Organize Files**.

## Week 2 Updates

- Added support for more file types, including audio, archives, code files, applications, fonts, and structured document formats.
- Added an `Organized_Files` folder so category folders stay together in one clean location.
- Added a **Preview** button to scan files before moving them.
- Added status messages and clearer error handling in the GUI.
- Kept the logic modular with `main.py` for the interface and `organizer.py` for backend file handling.

## Week 3 Updates

- Improved the GUI with a clear button, progress indicator, and cleaner status updates.
- Moved scan and organize operations to background threads so the interface remains responsive with larger folders.
- Limited very large result displays while still showing the total number of files processed.
- Improved preview accuracy when duplicate destination file names already exist.
- Continued code refinement with reusable GUI helper methods.

## Safety

If a file with the same name already exists in a category folder, the program keeps both files by adding a number to the new file name.

## Week 4 Final Updates

- Added custom category support so users can define their own sorting rules.
- Added saved preferences using `settings.json`.
- Added optional recursive scanning for subfolders.
- Added operation logging with timestamps in `organizer.log`.
- Added a user guide and unit tests.

## Final Testing

Run:

```bash
python -m unittest test_organizer.py
```
